# breast-cancer-classification-ml
Machine Learning Project for Breast Cancer classification using Scikit-learn and many more Python Libraries
Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to build a Machine Learning model to classify whether a patient has breast cancer (malignant or benign) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset. The model uses Logistic Regression for classification and various Python libraries for data preprocessing, visualization, and evaluation.

ðŸ›  Technologies & Libraries Used

Python
Pandas â†’ Data manipulation & preprocessing
Scikit-learn (sklearn) â†’ Logistic Regression model, train-test split, evaluation
Matplotlib â†’ Data visualization (graphs, plots,ROC Curve)


## âš™ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
